Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and
a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the
year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had
accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog.
Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up
a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off
until past midnight. The memory of this incident still
brought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes.
“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled,
“and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat
P a g e | 19 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – J.K. Rowling
finger threateningly at Harry — “we need to get a few things straight before
I go and collect her.”
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the
television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle
Vernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment.
“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil
tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.”
“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s
talking to me.”
“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he

had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know
anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any —
any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself,
got me?”
“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.
“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes
now slits in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge
you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably
Criminal Boys.”
“What?” Harry yelled.
“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be
trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at
Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge
coming for a week-long visit — it was the worst
birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,
including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks.

“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, “I’ll be off
to the station, then. Want to come
along for the ride, Dudders?”

“No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to
the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished
threatening Harry.
“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,”
said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond
hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie.”
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.
“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the
kitchen.
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified
trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he
got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to
the front door.
Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.
“I’m not taking you, ” he snarled as he turned to see
Harry watching him.
“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to
ask you something.”
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.
“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to
www.ztcprep.com
visit the village sometimes,” said Harry.
“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from
a hook next to the door.

“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry in a rush.
“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon.
“Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll
be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that
St. Whatsits —”
“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal
Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased
to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s
voice.
“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle
Vernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll
have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I
accidentally let something slip?”
“You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?”
roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist
raised. But Harry stood his ground.
www.ztcprep.com
“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt
Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.
Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an
ugly puce.
“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on
quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to
go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal
and everything.”
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it
over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was
throbbing in his temple.
P a g e | 22 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – J.K. Rowling
“Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your
behavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end
of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll
sign your ruddy form.”
He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and
slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of
glass at the top fell out.
Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back
www.ztcprep.com
upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a
real Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and sadly
he gathered up all his presents and his birthday
cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with
his homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol
seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both
asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then
poked them both awake.
“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to
clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after
you. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at
me like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes were
reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll
be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and
Hermione.”
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note
to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window
and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly
miserable, put the empty cage away inside the
wardrobe.

But Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no
time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for
Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their
guest.
P a g e | 23 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – J.K. Rowling
“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia
snapped as he reached the hall.
Harry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair
lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the
untidier he looked, the happier she would be.
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as
Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway,
then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the
garden path.
“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled
the door open.
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like
Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she
even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In
www.ztcprep.com
one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked
under the other was an old and evil-tempered
bulldog.
“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s
my neffy-poo?”
Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair
plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible
under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the
suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the wind out
of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and
planted a large kiss on his cheek.
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up
with Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for
it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley
had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
P a g e | 24 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – J.K. Rowling
“Petunia!” shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat
stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt
Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her
large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony cheekbone.
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut
www.ztcprep.com
the door.
“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”
“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said
Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen,
leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But
Harry wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with
Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the
case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long
as he could.
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge
had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper
was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt
Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool
flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.
“Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle
Vernon asked.
“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,”
boomed Aunt Marge. “He’s retired now, good for him
to have something to do. But I couldn’t leave poor old
Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.”

Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This
directed Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first
time.
“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”
“Yes,” said Harry.

“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt Marge growled. “It’s
damn good of Vernon and
Petunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself.
You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d
been dumped on my doorstep.”
Harry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an
orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of
the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face
into a painful smile.
“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can
see you haven’t improved since I last saw you. I hoped
school would knock some manners into you.” She
took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and
said, “Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?”
“St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a
